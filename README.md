# EigenNumpyBinder
Intended to exercise pybind11's Eigen/Numpy binding functionality

Each linear algebra routine is encapsulated in its own C++ class. The common interface to these routines on the Python side is nproutines.py

Supported routines:

 `Eigenvectors`
 
 `Partial pivoting LU decomposition`
 
 `Householder QR decomposition`
